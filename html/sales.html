    <h1>Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
    <p>Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. They were just sucked into space. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. What? We're not at all alike!</p>
