    <h1>Pat's Salmon Cookies</h1>
    <p>The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Yesterday I did not know how to eat gagh. Besides, you look good in a dress.</p>
