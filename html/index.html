Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? and attack the Romulans. The unexpected is our normal routine. Your shields were failing, sir. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. This should be interesting. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?<p>
    <p>We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. This should be interesting. Sure.
