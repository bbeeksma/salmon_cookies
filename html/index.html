        <p>Not if I weaken first. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? and attack the Romulans. The unexpected is our normal routine. Your shields were failing, sir. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. This should be interesting. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?<p>

        <p>And blowing into maximum warp speed, you appeared for an instant to be in two places at once. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Smooth as an android's bottom, eh, Data? You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Not if I weaken first. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? How long can two people talk about nothing? You enjoyed that. Your shields were failing, sir. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. and attack the Romulans.<p>

        <p>We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. This should be interesting. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Computer, belay that order. Talk about going nowhere fast. The unexpected is our normal routine. How long can two people talk about nothing? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here.<p>
