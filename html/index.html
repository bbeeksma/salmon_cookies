        <p>Not if I weaken first. We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? and attack the Romulans. The unexpected is our normal routine. Your shields were failing, sir. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would *never* do that to you. This should be interesting. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets?<p>

        <p>We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. This should be interesting. Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Computer, belay that order. Talk about going nowhere fast. The unexpected is our normal routine. How long can two people talk about nothing? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here.<p>
